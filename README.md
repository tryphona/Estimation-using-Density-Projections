# Estimation-using-Density-Projections
Code for MonteCarlo

This folder contains Matlab code to replicate the Monte Carlo exercises of the paper "Conditional Moment Restrictions and the role of Density Information in Estimated Structural Models"

-Euler equation (Conditional): 
main files: 
      -monte_carlo_euler_all: main file for the most general MC exercise 
      -monte_carlo_euler: main file for the MC exercise for many known parameters 
-Unconditional Moment restriction (MC exercise in the Appendix) 
main file: -monte_carlo_unc

Both main files compute MSE for GMM and then the MSE using our method.
